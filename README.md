For those who arenpt payoing yet would be able to navigate in the hole catalogue of comics and characters. There are some filters and search bars to offer a better UX. 
For the owner, there is a private module qhere ios possible to add and remove comics, upgrade users nd get stats about billing and other key points for bussines.
The design and componenting was made to be affordable and adaptatives.

## What more I Â´d like to let you know about this project?

This was a great experience were I had the opportunity to work in a team whom had to be coordinated to take to term a huge project y less than three weeks.
IÂ´m glad to the team for the support and for hearing when I proposed them to do something quite diferent as final project.
We lost some colegues in this journey, but that made us be even more effective and gave us the chance to take the best of each one.
</br>
At tech level, IÂ´ve definitely connected what I 've learned so far about React JS and its lifecycles, and implemented succesfully its latests features, such as hooks , React router v6, among others.
Although my participation was stronger in frontend, I was also actively involved in backend. At firs, defining the necesary routes to connect components and then in a more global way IÂ´ve colaborated ind the creation of models to improve database-
I learned about login libraries, and choose to implememt Auh0 . I also took care of protected routes to allow access according to user role.
Finally, this project gave me the chance to onvestigate about several libraries-some of them barely heard for me- some were implemented other have already become avaiÃ±able tools for future work.
